<p>Gsw is a package for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R statistical
    language</a> that helps Oceanographers do their work by providing an
interface to the <a href="http://teos-10.org/"> TEOS-10 Gibbs SeaWater
    library</a>.</p>

<p>Gsw may be used alone, or within the <a
href="http://dankelley.github.io/oce/">oce</a> package.</p>

<p>Gsw is still in active development, with a CRAN submission planned for the
end of January 2015.  The development website is on <a
href="https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-R">github</a>.</p>
