<p>Suppose a water sample is taken at 100dbar pressure, longitude 188 east,
latitude 4 north, and that it has Practical Salinity 35 and in-situ temperature
10C on the (ITS-90) scale. To calculate its Absolute Salinity, do as
follows.</p>

{% highlight R %}
library(gsw)
SA <- gsw_SA_from_SP(SP=35, p=100, longitude=188, latitude=4)
SA
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, we can use this Absolute Salinity, along with in-situ temperature and
pressure, to calculate the Conservative temperature as follows.</p>

{% highlight R %}
library(gsw)
CT <- gsw_CT_from_t(SA=SA, t=10, p=100)
CT
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This should give a flavour for the work. See the Documentation tab for a
list of functions provided in this package, and note that the R help pages
mainly outline the function arguments, relying on links to the official
TEOS-10/GSW documentation to educate users further.</p>
