<p>The gsw package is currently not available on CRAN, and therefore can only be installed from source. The authors intend to submit to CRAN sometime in early 2015.</p>

<p>Users who are set up to build packages (which requires a C compiler, etc)
may stay at the cutting edge by installing a development version.  This may be
done as follows, within an R session.</p>

{% highlight R %}
library(devtools)
install_github("TEOS-10/GSW-R", "master")
{% endhighlight %}
